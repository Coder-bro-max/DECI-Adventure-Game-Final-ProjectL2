# DECI-Adventure-Game-Final-ProjectL2
This repository hosts the code and docs for a text-based adventure game. Developed as the final project for the DECI Program Level 2, it offers an immersive experience with dynamic scenarios and outcomes, showcasing proficiency in Python and game design. It demonstrates my developer's skills ( as a beginner as of 05/07/24 ) in time management and efficient problem-solving. The project offers valuable practical experience and an opportunity to apply and expand programming skills.

# Overview
This project is a simple text-based adventure game where players navigate through various scenarios by making choices. The game provides a description of each scenario and prompts the player to make a choice, with different outcomes depending on the choice made. It includes conditions for winning and losing, allowing players to play again after the game is over. Additionally, the game incorporates random factors to add variability and replayability.
